        The University of Washington (UW, simply Washington, or informally U-Dub) is a public research university in
        Seattle, Washington, United States. Founded in 1861, Washington is one of the oldest universities on the West
        Coast; it was established in downtown Seattle approximately a decade after the city's founding to aid its
        economic development. Today, the university's 703-acre main Seattle campus is in the University District above
        the Montlake Cut, within the urban Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest.

        The university has additional campuses in Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses over 500 buildings and
        over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with
        more than 26 university libraries, as well as the UW Tower, lecture halls, art centers, museums, laboratories,
        stadiums, and conference centers. The university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees through 140
        departments in various colleges and schools, sees a total student enrollment of roughly 46,000 annually, and
